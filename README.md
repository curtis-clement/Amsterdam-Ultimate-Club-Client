## What This App is For
This application is (in the processes of being) designed for Amsterdam Ultimate Club which is an Ultimate Frisbee club based in Amsterdam at Sportpark Drieburg. The main goals of this application are:
  - To provide information about AUC and the Ultimate community at large
  - To allow anyone to joint the AUC mailing list
  - To allow a new member to sign up to be part of the club
  - To allow the creation of new teams and the ability to assign players to teams
  - To display current teams
  - To remove teams

## What It Is Trying To Do

The goal of this application is to take the static version of the current Amsterdam Ultimate page and integrate solutions that will solve other tasks and league responsibilities in one location. While the current league operation is functional and works well for those that know it, it is not very streamlined and is difficult to know who or what to reference or go to if you need information on something. The goal is to have all of the resources for the league be available in one place so that potential new players can find it easy to get involved and returning palyers can have one place to login that will serve all of their needs for the league. This will also allow consolidation of league information for easy access by the board which will help to faciliate quicker turnaround when completing tasks like making teams or ordering gear.

## Future 
The future goal of this application is integrate much or functionality into the app and eventually allow customization for use other teams. The current standard in terms of website and application design for the ultimate community is somewhat lacking so eventually the goal is that this application can be used by numerous ultimate clubs around the country and globe. A mobile version is also a future goal. In addition to the current features the website will also be able to:
  - Display team gear
  - Allow a user to submit an order for gear
  - Create administrators and remove sensitive parts of the app from non-admins
  - Contain and up to date calendar of league events
  - A board member page where each board member is displayed with a bio
  - A city league section to allow sign up and management of city league
  - A page with player statistics for the current season
  - Sponorship information
